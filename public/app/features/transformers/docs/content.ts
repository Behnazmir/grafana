  configFromData: {
    name: 'Config from query results',
    helperDocs: `
  Use this transformation to select one query and from it extract standard options such as
  **Min**, **Max**, **Unit**, and **Thresholds** and apply them to other query results.
  This enables dynamic query driven visualization configuration.
  ### Options
  - **Config query**: Selet the query that returns the data you want to use as configuration.
  - **Apply to**: Select what fields or series to apply the configuration to.
  - **Apply to options**: Usually a field type or field name regex depending on what option you selected in **Apply to**.
  ### Field mapping table
  Below the configuration listed above you will find the field table. Here all fields found in the data returned by the config query will be listed along with a **Use as** and **Select** option. This table gives you control over what field should be mapped to which config property and if there are multiple rows which value to select.
  #### Example
  Input[0] (From query: A, name: ServerA)
  | Time          | Value |
  | ------------- | ----- |
  | 1626178119127 | 10    |
  | 1626178119129 | 30    |
  Input[1] (From query: B)
  | Time          | Value |
  | ------------- | ----- |
  | 1626178119127 | 100   |
  | 1626178119129 | 100   |
  Output (Same as Input[0] but now with config on the Value field)
  | Time          | Value (config: Max=100) |
  | ------------- | ----------------------- |
  | 1626178119127 | 10                      |
  | 1626178119129 | 30                      |
  Each row in the source data becomes a separate field. Each field now also has a maximum
  configuration option set. Options such as **min**, **max**, **unit**, and **thresholds** are all part of field configuration, and if they are set like this, they will be used by the visualization instead of any options that are manually configured.
  in the panel editor options pane.
  #### Value mappings
  You can also transform a query result into value mappings. This is is a bit different because every
  row in the configuration query result is used to define a single value mapping row. See the following example.
  Config query result:
  | Value | Text   | Color |
  | ----- | ------ | ----- |
  | L     | Low    | blue  |
  | M     | Medium | green |
  | H     | High   | red   |
  In the field mapping specify:
  | Field | Use as                  | Select     |
  | ----- | ----------------------- | ---------- |
  | Value | Value mappings / Value  | All values |
  | Text  | Value mappings / Text   | All values |
  | Color | Value mappings / Ciolor | All values |
  Grafana will build the value mappings from you query result and apply it the the real data query results. You should see values being mapped and colored according to the config query results.

  Use this transformation to filter your data directly in Grafana and remove some data points from your query result. You have the option to include or exclude data that match one or more conditions you define. The conditions are applied on a selected field.
  This transformation is very useful if your data source does not natively filter by values. You might also use this to narrow values to display if you are using a shared query.
  The available conditions for all fields are:
  - **Regex:** Match a regex expression
  - **Is Null:** Match if the value is null
  - **Is Not Null:** Match if the value is not null
  - **Equal:** Match if the value is equal to the specified value
  - **Different:** Match if the value is different than the specified value
  The available conditions for number fields are:
  - **Greater:** Match if the value is greater than the specified value
  - **Lower:** Match if the value is lower than the specified value
  - **Greater or equal:** Match if the value is greater or equal
  - **Lower or equal:** Match if the value is lower or equal
  - **Range:** Match a range between a specified minimum and maximum, min and max included
  Consider the following data set:
  #### Data Set Example
  | Time                | Temperature | Altitude |
  |---------------------|-------------|----------|
  | 2020-07-07 11:34:23 | 32          | 101      |

  If you **Include** the data points that have a temperature below 30°C, the configuration will look as follows:
  - Filter Type: 'Include'
  - Condition: Rows where 'Temperature' matches 'Lower Than' '30'
  And you will get the following result, where only the temperatures below 30°C are included:
  #### Transformed Data
  | Time                | Temperature | Altitude |
  |---------------------|-------------|----------|
  | 2020-07-07 11:34:22 | 28          | 125      |

  | 2020-07-07 09:30:57 | 19          | 101      |
  You can add more than one condition to the filter. For example, you might want to include the data only if the altitude is greater than 100. To do so, add that condition to the following configuration:
  - Filter type: 'Include' rows that 'Match All' conditions
  - Condition 1: Rows where 'Temperature' matches 'Lower' than '30'
  - Condition 2: Rows where 'Altitude' matches 'Greater' than '100'
  When you have more than one condition, you can choose if you want the action (include / exclude) to be applied on rows that **Match all** conditions or **Match any** of the conditions you added.
  In the example above, we chose **Match all** because we wanted to include the rows that have a temperature lower than 30°C *AND* an altitude higher than 100. If we wanted to include the rows that have a temperature lower than 30°C *OR* an altitude higher than 100 instead, then we would select **Match any**. This would include the first row in the original data, which has a temperature of 32°C (does not match the first condition) but an altitude of 101 (which matches the second condition), so it is included.
  Conditions that are invalid or incompletely configured are ignored.

  This transformation goes in two steps. First you specify one or multiple fields to group the data by. This will group all the same values of those fields together, as if you sorted them. For instance if we group by the Server ID field, then it would group the data this way:
  | Time                | Server ID      | CPU Temperature | Server Status |
  | ------------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
  | 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | **server 1**   | 80              | Shutdown      |
  | 2020-07-07 09:28:06 | **server 1**   | 80              | OK            |
  | 2020-07-07 09:23:07 | **server 1**   | 86              | OK            |
  | 2020-07-07 10:32:20 | server 2       | 90              | Overload      |
  | 2020-07-07 09:30:05 | server 2       | 88              | OK            |

  | 2020-07-07 09:30:57 | **_server 3_** | 62              | Rebooting     |
  All rows with the same value of Server ID are grouped together.
  After choosing which field you want to group your data by, you can add various calculations on the other fields, and apply the calculation to each group of rows. For instance, we could want to calculate the average CPU temperature for each of those servers. So we can add the _mean_ calculation applied on the CPU Temperature field to get the following:
  | Server ID | CPU Temperature (mean) |
  | --------- | ---------------------- |
  | server 1  | 82                     |
  | server 2  | 88.6                   |
  | server 3  | 59.6                   |
  And we can add more than one calculation. For instance:
  - For field Time, we can calculate the _Last_ value, to know when the last data point was received for each server
  - For field Server Status, we can calculate the _Last_ value to know what is the last state value for each server
  - For field Temperature, we can also calculate the _Last_ value to know what is the latest monitored temperature for each server
  We would then get :
  | Server ID | CPU Temperature (mean) | CPU Temperature (last) | Time (last)         | Server Status (last) |
  | --------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
  | server 1  | 82                     | 80                     | 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | Shutdown             |
  | server 2  | 88.6                   | 90                     | 2020-07-07 10:32:20 | Overload             |
  | server 3  | 59.6                   | 62                     | 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | OK                   |

  joinByField: {
    name: 'Join by field',
    helperDocs: `
  Use this transformation to join multiple results into a single table. This is especially useful for converting multiple
  time series results into a single wide table with a shared time field.
  #### Inner join
  An inner join merges data from multiple tables where all tables share the same value from the selected field. This type of join excludes
  data where values do not match in every result.
  Use this transformation to combine the results from multiple queries (combining on a passed join field or the first time column) into one result, and drop rows where a successful join cannot occur.
  In the following example, two queries return table data. It is visualized as two separate tables before applying the inner join transformation.
  Query A:
  | Time                | Job     | Uptime    |
  | ------------------- | ------- | --------- |
  | 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | node    | 25260122  |
  | 2020-07-07 11:24:20 | postgre | 123001233 |
  | 2020-07-07 11:14:20 | postgre | 345001233 |
  Query B:
  | Time                | Server   | Errors |
  | ------------------- | -------- | ------ |
  | 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | server 1 | 15     |
  | 2020-07-07 11:24:20 | server 2 | 5      |
  | 2020-07-07 11:04:20 | server 3 | 10     |
  The result after applying the inner join transformation looks like the following:
  | Time                | Job     | Uptime    | Server   | Errors |
  | ------------------- | ------- | --------- | -------- | ------ |
  | 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | node    | 25260122  | server 1 | 15     |
  | 2020-07-07 11:24:20 | postgre | 123001233 | server 2 | 5      |
  #### Outer join
  An outer join includes all data from an inner join and rows where values do not match in every input. While the inner join joins Query A and Query B on the time field, the outer join includes all rows that don't match on the time field.
  In the following example, two queries return table data. It is visualized as two tables before applying the outer join transformation.
  Query A:
  | Time                | Job     | Uptime    |
  | ------------------- | ------- | --------- |
  | 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | node    | 25260122  |

  | 2020-07-07 11:04:20 | server 3 | 10     |
  The result after applying the outer join transformation looks like the following:
  | Time                | Job     | Uptime    | Server   | Errors |
  | ------------------- | ------- | --------- | -------- | ------ |

  joinByLabels: {
    name: 'Join by labels',
    helperDocs: `
  Use this transformation to join multiple results into a single table. This is especially useful for converting multiple
  time series results into a single wide table with a shared **Label** field.
  - **Join** - Select the label to join by between the labels available or common across all time series.
  - **Value** - The name for the output result.

  labelsToFields: {
    name: 'Labels to fields',
    helperDocs: `
  Use this transformation to change time series results that include labels or tags into a table where each label's keys and values are included in the table result. The labels can be displayed as either columns or row values.
  Given a query result of two time series:
  - Series 1: labels Server=Server A, Datacenter=EU
  - Series 2: labels Server=Server B, Datacenter=EU
  In "Columns" mode, the result looks like this:
  | Time                | Server   | Datacenter | Value |
  | ------------------- | -------- | ---------- | ----- |
  | 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | Server A | EU         | 1     |
  | 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | Server B | EU         | 2     |
  In "Rows" mode, the result has a table for each series and show each label value like this:
  | label      | value    |
  | ---------- | -------- |
  | Server     | Server A |
  | Datacenter | EU       |
  | label      | value    |
  | ---------- | -------- |
  | Server     | Server B |
  | Datacenter | EU       |
  #### Value field name
  If you selected Server as the **Value field name**, then you would get one field for every value of the Server label.
  | Time                | Datacenter | Server A | Server B |
  | ------------------- | ---------- | -------- | -------- |
  | 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | EU         | 1        | 2        |
  #### Merging behavior
  The labels to fields transformer is internally two separate transformations. The first acts on single series and extracts labels to fields. The second is the [merge](#merge) transformation that joins all the results into a single table. The merge transformation tries to join on all matching fields. This merge step is required and cannot be turned off.
  To illustrate this, here is an example where you have two queries that return time series with no overlapping labels.
  - Series 1: labels Server=ServerA
  - Series 2: labels Datacenter=EU
  This will first result in these two tables:
  | Time                | Server  | Value |
  | ------------------- | ------- | ----- |
  | 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | ServerA | 10    |
  | Time                | Datacenter | Value |
  | ------------------- | ---------- | ----- |
  | 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | EU         | 20    |
  After merge:
  | Time                | Server  | Value | Datacenter |
  | ------------------- | ------- | ----- | ---------- |
  | 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | ServerA | 10    |            |

  Use this transformation to combine the result from multiple queries into one single result. This is helpful when using the table panel visualization. Values that can be merged are combined into the same row. Values are mergeable if the shared fields contain the same data. For information, refer to [Table panel][].
  In the example below, we have two queries returning table data. It is visualized as two separate tables before applying the transformation.

  partitionByValues: {
    name: 'Partition by values',
    helperDocs: `
  Use this transformation to eliminate the need for multiple queries to the same data source with different 'WHERE' clauses when graphing multiple series. Consider a metrics SQL table with the following data:
  | Time                | Region | Value |
  | ------------------- | ------ | ----- |
  | 2022-10-20 12:00:00 | US     | 1520  |
  | 2022-10-20 12:00:00 | EU     | 2936  |
  | 2022-10-20 01:00:00 | US     | 1327  |
  | 2022-10-20 01:00:00 | EU     | 912   |
  Prior to v9.3, if you wanted to plot a red trendline for US and a blue one for EU in the same TimeSeries panel, you would likely have to split this into two queries:
  'SELECT Time, Value FROM metrics WHERE Time > "2022-10-20" AND Region="US"'<br>
  'SELECT Time, Value FROM metrics WHERE Time > "2022-10-20" AND Region="EU"'
  This also requires you to know ahead of time which regions actually exist in the metrics table.
  With the _Partition by values_ transformer, you can now issue a single query and split the results by unique values in one or more columns ('fields') of your choosing. The following example uses 'Region'.
  'SELECT Time, Region, Value FROM metrics WHERE Time > "2022-10-20"'
  | Time                | Region | Value |
  | ------------------- | ------ | ----- |
  | 2022-10-20 12:00:00 | US     | 1520  |

  reduce: {
    name: 'Reduce',
    helperDocs: `
  Use this transformation to apply a calculation to each field in the frame and return a single value. Time fields are removed when applying this transformation.
  Consider the input:
  Query A:
  | Time                | Temp | Uptime  |
  | ------------------- | ---- | ------- |
  | 2020-07-07 11:34:20 | 12.3 | 256122  |
  | 2020-07-07 11:24:20 | 15.4 | 1230233 |

  | 2020-07-07 11:24:20 | 3.2 | 5      |
  The reduce transformer has two modes:
  - **Series to rows -** Creates a row for each field and a column for each calculation.
  - **Reduce fields -** Keeps the existing frame structure, but collapses each field into a single value.
  For example, if you used the **First** and **Last** calculation with a **Series to rows** transformation, then
  the result would be:
  | Field  | First  | Last    |
  | ------ | ------ | ------- |
  | Temp   | 12.3   | 15.4    |
  | Uptime | 256122 | 1230233 |
  | AQI    | 6.5    | 3.2     |
  | Errors | 15     | 5       |

  results in two frames, each with one row:
  Query A:

  Use this transformation to rename parts of the query results using a regular expression and replacement pattern.
  You can specify a regular expression, which is only applied to matches, along with a replacement pattern that support back references. For example, let's imagine you're visualizing CPU usage per host and you want to remove the domain name. You could set the regex to '([^\.]+)\..+' and the replacement pattern to '$1', 'web-01.example.com' would become 'web-01'.

  },
  rowsToFields: {
    name: 'Rows to fields',
    helperDocs: `
  Use this transformation to convert rows into separate fields. This can be useful because fields can be styled and configured individually. It can also use additional fields as sources for dynamic field configuration or map them to field labels. The additional labels can then be used to define better display names for the resulting fields.
  This transformation includes a field table which lists all fields in the data returned by the config query. This table gives you control over what field should be mapped to each config property (the \*Use as\*\* option). You can also choose which value to select if there are multiple rows in the returned data.
  This transformation requires:
  - One field to use as the source of field names.
    By default, the transform uses the first string field as the source. You can override this default setting by selecting **Field name** in the **Use as** column for the field you want to use instead.
  - One field to use as the source of values.
    By default, the transform uses the first number field as the source. But you can override this default setting by selecting **Field value** in the **Use as** column for the field you want to use instead.
  Useful when visualizing data in:
  - Gauge
  - Stat
  - Pie chart
  #### Map extra fields to labels
  If a field does not map to config property Grafana will automatically use it as source for a label on the output field-
  Example:
  | Name    | DataCenter | Value |
  | ------- | ---------- | ----- |
  | ServerA | US         | 100   |
  | ServerB | EU         | 200   |
  Output:
  | ServerA (labels: DataCenter: US) | ServerB (labels: DataCenter: EU) |
  | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
  | 10                               | 20                               |
  The extra labels can now be used in the field display name provide more complete field names.
  If you want to extract config from one query and appply it to another you should use the config from query results transformation.
  #### Example
  Input:
  | Name    | Value | Max |
  | ------- | ----- | --- |
  | ServerA | 10    | 100 |
  | ServerB | 20    | 200 |
  | ServerC | 30    | 300 |
  Output:
  | ServerA (config: max=100) | ServerB (config: max=200) | ServerC (config: max=300) |
  | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
  | 10                        | 20                        | 30                        |
  As you can see each row in the source data becomes a separate field. Each field now also has a max config option set. Options like **Min**, **Max**, **Unit** and **Thresholds** are all part of field configuration and if set like this will be used by the visualization instead of any options manually configured in the panel editor options pane.

  Use this transformation to combine the result from multiple time series data queries into one single result. This is helpful when using the table panel visualization.
  The result from this transformation will contain three columns: Time, Metric, and Value. The Metric column is added so you easily can see from which query the metric originates from. Customize this value by defining Label on the source query.

    helperDocs: `
  Use this transformation to convert time series results into a table, converting a time series data frame into a trend visualization field. A trend field can then be rendered using the [sparkline cell type][], producing an inline sparkline for each table row. If there are multiple time series queries, each will result in a separate table data frame. These can be joined using join or merge transforms to produce a single table with multiple sparklines per row.
  > **Note:** This transformation is available in Grafana 9.5+ as an opt-in beta feature. Modify Grafana [configuration file][] to use it.
